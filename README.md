1. O(1) --> constant time operation
2. O(n) --> because we have to shift every element in the array one position to
   the right. So, for an array of length size n, it is n times 0(1), which is
   O(n).
3. O(1) --> constant-time operation.
4. O(n) --> go through each element and convert to upper case.
5. O(n) --> linear time
6. 0(nlogn) --> because, best sorting algorithm we know(merge sort) takes
   O(nlogn) run-time.
